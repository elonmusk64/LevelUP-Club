Probelms I got during my Development process 

1. correctly add the post man mechanism before sending the request make sure in the route of login you properly use this feature 
  Body -> raw -> -> Json    and then send the request 


2. make sure you propely add the details that are supposed to be inserted in 
ðŸ”¹ In Postman:
Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/profile
Go to the "Headers" tab
Add:
--------------------------------------------
| Key	       |     Value                 |
|Authorization |	Bearer your_token_here |
|Content-Type  |	application/json       |
--------------------------------------------
You can also go to the "Authorization" tab, select:
Type: Bearer Token
Token: Paste only the token (not "Bearer", just the JWT string)

3. Always crete proper export statement for all the fils 
4. The xp route is in the achivements.js file 
5. we are giving 50 xp for each achivements 
6. While creating the table of taskes in pgsql i have used the check function of sql which allows us to use options in the data
as a check box 
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    xp_reward INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    frequency VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (frequency IN ('daily', 'monthly', 'yearly')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
